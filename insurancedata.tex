\section{Insurance Data}

Given our background in actuarial science, we want to research some relevant insurance data.


The focus of this section is the application of the `s()` function within the \textbf{glmmTMB} package to insurance data. Our background provides a perspective on the importance of this approach. The flexibility of GAMs, enabled by spline smoothing, is well-suited to addressing common challenges in insurance data analysis such as claim frequency, severity distributions, and the presence of covariates with non-linear effects.


Through this analysis, we aim to demonstrate the efficacy of spline-based smoothing in uncovering insights from insurance data, which are often hidden when using more traditional linear models. We will explore how the `s()` function can be applied to various types of insurance data, discussing its implications for risk assessment, premium pricing, and overall decision-making processes in actuarial practices.
