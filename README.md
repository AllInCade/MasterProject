# README: Exploring Spline Regression Models in glmmTMB

## Project Overview

This repository contains the R scripts and related materials for me and my colleagues Master's thesis titled "Exploring Spline Regression Models in glmmTMB." The main goal of this thesis is to implement smooth terms functionality in the `glmmTMB` package using the existing machinery from `mgcv`. This work includes assessing the compatibility of `glmmTMB` with `mgcv`, identifying challenges in integration, and evaluating the pros and cons of this approach. The thesis also explores the ease of use of these models and tests them on real data sets, including financial time series data, insurance data, and weather data.

## Repository Structure

R_Scripts: Contains all R scripts developed for this thesis. Each script is named according to its purpose and data set.
Data: This folder includes sample data sets used in the thesis. Due to confidentiality and size, some data sets may be represented by simulated or anonymized versions.
Documentation: Any additional documentation, including notes on challenges and solutions encountered during the implementation.
Results: Output from the R scripts, including tables, figures, and model summaries.

## Getting Started

To use the contents of this repository:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R packages listed in `requirements.R`.
3. Run the R scripts in the `/R_Scripts` directory to replicate the analysis.

## Contributions and Contact

While this repository primarily serves as a part of my Master's thesis at the University of Bergen, contributions, suggestions, or questions are welcome. Please feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
