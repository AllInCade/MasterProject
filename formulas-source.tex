Learning, splines knots piecewise

Smoothing splines are similar to regression splines, but arise in a
slightly different situation. Smoothing splines result from minimizing
a residual sum of squares criterion subject to a smoothness penalty

\[
g(\mu_i) = A_i\theta + f_1(x_{1i}) + f_2(x_{2i}) + f_3(x_{3i}, x_{4i}) + \ldots
\]
